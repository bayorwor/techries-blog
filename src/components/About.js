            With this deal access strategy, you can afford to spend more time
            building your brand among LPs (as opposed to spending all your time
            building your brand among founders). There are multiple sources of
            investment data such as CrunchBase or CB Insights, use that to
            continuously post new research on VC funds performance, or case
            studies on funds, or new investment trends. Then meet new LPs every
            week, and use your research as an entry point, i.e., to share with
            them your findings and initiate the relationship. At the end of the
            day, not every meeting with an LP should be for fundraising,
            connecting with institutional LPs takes years of relationship
            building. In summary, I think first time VC fund managers with small
            funds need to think more late stage via other VC firms (as follow
            investors) and focus on LPs relationships, as opposed to, thinking
            seed stage and focusing on founders relationships.
